This project is a platoform where the user can consult application's protaganist, Bot the doc. The user will be able to interact with bot via textual input and respond as per bot's CSE (context synthesisation Engine). CSE is based on Neural Network system and the bot's algorithm is so designed to predict possible health issues based on symptoms provided by the user.
